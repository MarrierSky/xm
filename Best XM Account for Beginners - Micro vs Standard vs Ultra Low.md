## **Micro Account – The Top Pick for New Traders**

### **Key Features:**

- **Minimum Deposit**: $5  
- **Contract Size**: 1 lot = 1,000 units  
- **Leverage**: Up to 1:1000 (varies by region)  
- **Spread**: From 1 pip  
- **Commission**: None  
- **Base Currencies**: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CHF, HUF, PLN, RUB, ZAR  
- **Platforms**: MT4 and MT5  

### **Why It's Best for Beginners**

The **Micro Account** allows users to trade **micro-lots**, which significantly limits exposure and risk. This means that even if mistakes are made, the impact on capital is minimal. The **$5 minimum deposit** allows anyone to start trading without heavy capital commitment. Furthermore, **no commissions** and competitive spreads make this account a cost-effective entry point.

### **Who Should Use It?**

- Absolute beginners with no prior trading experience  
- Traders looking to test the platform or develop a strategy  
- Individuals with limited capital who wish to learn by doing

## **Standard Account – For Scaling Beginners**

### **Key Features:**

- **Minimum Deposit**: $5  
- **Contract Size**: 1 lot = 100,000 units  
- **Leverage**: Up to 1:1000  
- **Spread**: From 1 pip  
- **Commission**: None  
- **Base Currencies**: Same as Micro Account  
- **Platforms**: MT4 and MT5  

### **Why It’s a Strong Second Option**

The **Standard Account** offers identical trading conditions to the Micro Account, except for the **contract size**. Instead of micro-lots, traders work with standard lots, which offer larger profits but come with higher risk. For beginners who are confident and want to scale up their exposure without incurring commissions, this account offers a natural progression from the Micro Account.

### **Who Should Use It?**

- Beginners with basic knowledge of risk management  
- Traders moving up from micro-lots to standard lots  
- Individuals who want to test real market conditions with standard volume

- **Leverage**: Up to 1:1000  
- **Base Currencies**: USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, ZAR  
- **Account Types**: Ultra Low Micro and Ultra Low Standard  

### **Pros and Cons**

While the **Ultra Low Account** offers tighter spreads, it also has a higher minimum deposit and more limited currency options. The lower spreads may appeal to scalpers, but for beginners, the slight cost savings may not justify the reduced flexibility and higher initial deposit.

### **Who Should Use It?**

- Traders transitioning from beginner to intermediate  
- Spread-conscious traders using scalping or day trading strategies  
- Beginners with more capital who seek tighter pricing

- **Leverage**: None (1:1 only)  
- **Commission**: Yes  
- **Platforms**: MT5 only  

### **Unsuitable for Beginners**

The **Shares Account** is designed for experienced traders who wish to invest in actual shares rather than CFDs. With a high minimum deposit and limited leverage, this account requires a deep understanding of equity markets. It is not ideal for beginners looking to gain practical experience through small trades and flexible strategies.
